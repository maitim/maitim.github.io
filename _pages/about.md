I'm a PhD student with the [Earth System Model Evaluation and Analysis (EVA)](https://www.dlr.de/en/pa/about-us/departments/earth-system-model-evaluation) Department at the Institue of Atmospheric Physics of the DLR together with TU Munich, working on machine learning approaches to improve climate models :earth_africa:

My research interests are

- Probabilistic ML / Bayesian deep learning
- Uncertainty quantification
- Climate foundation models

Previously, I studied Computer Science at [KIT](https://www.kit.edu/) and Machine Learning (MSc) at [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/), where I did my thesis on [malaria-related protein prediction](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/Supplement_1/i86/7210434).
For some time I was also a ML software engineer in predictive plant breeding at [Computomics](https://www.computomics.com/home.html).

In my spare time, I like to ride all kinds of bikes and spending time in the mountains :bicyclist: :ski: :mount_fuji:.
